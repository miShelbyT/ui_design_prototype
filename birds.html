      <h1>Birds</h1>
      <p>
        Birds are very intriguing creatures as they can range from birds as
        small as a Cuban bee hummingbird (about two inches long and a little
        over 1/20 of an ounce) to as large as an ostrich. While most birds fly,
        there are some that don't. Birds are amazing and each breed is unique in
        its own way, particularly when it comes to their relational needs and
        well-being. Unfortunately, birds can experience sadness and depression
        just like humans. A number of root causes may be responsible for your
        bird's depression such as an illness (either physical or mental), losing
        its companion, or increasingly becoming bored. Some signs to help
        identify if your bird is experiencing depression may include the
        following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>reduced appetite</li>
        <li>becoming increasingly irritable</li>
        <li>aggressive behavior</li>
        <li>songs have a different, more solemn tone</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Be sure to tell your veterinarian if you see signs of any of these
        symptoms. Just like many illnesses, identifying and treating the
        symptoms earlier may drastically increase the lifespan of your birdie.
