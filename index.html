            <p>
              <span> Pets are nature's gift to humanity. </span>
              It has been scientifically proven that opening our homes and
              hearts to a pet increases our longevity and improves our overall
              quality of life as well as the lives of our pets.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              At Pet Paradigm Professionals, our mission is to offer resources
              to help you care for your furry, scaly, feathery, and slimy loved
              ones. Our pet experts—or “Pexperts”—have been working with pet
              owners and professionals alike for the past twelve years. They
              offer one-on-one consultations with current and prospective pet
              owners as well as group presentations designed for veterinary, pet
              shelter, and pet breeding professionals.
