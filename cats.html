      <h1>Cats</h1>
      <p>
        Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region
        and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United
        States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and
        diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are
        generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member
        regardless of breed.

      <h2>Zero to Four Weeks</h2>
      <p>
        It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is
        either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible.
        Monitor your kitten’s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is
        progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate,
        a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle
        or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight
        appropriately include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
        <li>gastrointestinal disease</li>
        <li>
          environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary
          conditions
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Four Weeks to One Year</h2>
      <p>
        Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically
        around three to four weeks after birth. According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>, kittens
        at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine
        ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties
        eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the
        food. Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional
        nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on
        the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should
        always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.
      </p>

      <h2>One Year to Seven Years</h2>
      <p>
        This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many
        nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does
        their metabolism. It is not recommended to leave food out for the cats
        all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals
        rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk
        of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.

      <h2>Seven Years and More</h2>
      <p>
        Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and
        experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and
        calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing
        packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular
        protein (such as "salmon") and not just a category (such as fish). This
        usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality
        proteins.
