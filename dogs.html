            The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse
            variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by
            the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits
            between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of
            having a companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness
            from adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators such as
            <a

              >reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles</a
            >. If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for
            your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough
            opportunities for exercise. In this page, you will find more
            information about how to care for your pets throughout the various
            stages of their lives.

        <h2>Diet & Exercise</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals
          as they mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then
          introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to six
          months years old. Their food intake should be reduced to two meals per
          day when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced to
          one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog’s typical body mass
          is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The
          <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips"
            >ASPCA</a
          >
          says just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a
          15 percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch
          hydrated!
        </p>

        <p>
          Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to
          keep their organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The minimum
          recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed and size
          differences, but generally a range of 30–120 minutes of exercise is
          recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK,
          I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But the thought
          of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way, exercising your dog does
          not mean you are being challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks
          are OK too! You can also choose from a variety of toys to encourage
          physical activity; just be sure they are age appropriate and do not
          pose a choking hazard. Pay careful attention to toys that require
          supervision.

        <h2>Grooming & Handling</h2>
        <p>
          Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health. So
          be sure to brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and
          prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely
          difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas,
          especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only
          important to your dog’s health but can be an exercise depending on how
          strong willed the dog is. Rinse all of the soap out, as any residual
          soap can result in a rash. Be sure the soap is formulated for your
          puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can cause allergic reactions. And as
          always, be careful how you handle your loved one. No matter the size
          of your dog, you need to be cautious as you carry your canine. If you
          have a small dog, then cradle the pup with one hand under the chest
          and the forearm supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach
          under the belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use
          each arm to support the chest and rear as you lift.

        <h2>Vaccinations & Medications</h2>
        <p>
          You should <span class="bold">always</span> consult with your
          veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that are typically
          recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such as
          hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by your
          vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some of
          these include
